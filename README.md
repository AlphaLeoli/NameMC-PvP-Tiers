# NameMC PvP Tiers

### How to Install:
In order to install, you can either install [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) and then create a new script and paste in the code, or you can just install it way quicker by clicking [this link](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/499332-namemc-pvp-tiers-display)

### Description:
This script shows you the pvp tiers of a user on namemc. It gets the information from [mctiers.com](mctiers.com)'s api thingy. Also, I suppose I should probably show you how it looks so u wanna install it more.

This is what you're supposed to be looking at in the images below
