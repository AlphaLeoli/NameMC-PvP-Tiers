# NameMC PvP Tiers

### Description:
This script shows you the pvp tiers of a user on namemc. It gets the information from [mctiers.com](mctiers.com)'s api thingy. Also, I suppose I should probably show you how it looks so u wanna install it more.

### Planned Features
- join [my discord server](https://discord.gg/hZNyQE3nJy) to make suggestions
- overall ranking next to name
- show badges you have
    - partially implemented, but only two badges. i need them to make a better format for badges before i continue
- show rankings for each tier

### How to Install:
In order to install, you can either install [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) and then create a new script and paste in the code, or you can just install it way quicker by clicking [this link](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/499332-namemc-pvp-tiers-display)

If you want to configure the script, then there are some convenient settings you can edit. Just open the script and they will be at the top.
