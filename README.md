# NameMC PvP Tiers

### How to Install:
In order to install, you can either install [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) and then create a new script and paste in the code, or you can just install it way quicker by clicking [this link](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/499332-namemc-pvp-tiers-display)

### Description:
This script shows you the pvp tiers of a user on namemc. It gets the information from [mctiers.com](mctiers.com)'s api thingy. Also, I suppose I should probably show you how it looks so u wanna install it more.

This is what you're supposed to be looking at in the images below

### Planned Features
I think in the future I'll make it so that it shows your overall ranking next to your name. I'll also make it show badges that you have. Next to the actual tiers, I will make it show your ranking for that tier as well as your peak tier. And i guess you can make suggestions if you add me on discord or join [my discord server](https://discord.gg/hZNyQE3nJy)
